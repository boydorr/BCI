#' Barro Colorado Island dataset
#'
#' The 50-hectare plot at Barro Colorado Island, Panama, is a 1000
#' meter by 500 meter rectangle of forest inside of which all woody
#' trees and shrubs with stems at least 1 cm in stem diameter have
#' been censused. Every individual tree in the 50 hectares was
#' permanently numbered with an aluminium tag in 1981/2, and every
#' individual has been revisited six times since (in 1985, 1990, 1995,
#' 2000, 2005, and 2010). In each census, every tree was measured,
#' mapped and identified to species. Details of the census method are
#' presented in Condit (Tropical forest census plots: Methods and
#' results from Barro Colorado Island, Panama and a comparison with
#' other plots; Springer-Verlag, 1998), and a description of the
#' seven-census results in Condit, Chisholm, and Hubbell (Thirty years
#' of forest census at Barro Colorado and the Importance of
#' Immigration in maintaining diversity; PLoS ONE, 7:e49826, 2012).
